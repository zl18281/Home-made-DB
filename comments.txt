Code Quality Feedback for 97610:
Some of your method names are potentially problematic in that they don't conform to recommendations (they aren't verbs, checks or event handlers). Your variable names are also generally quite short and as a result it is sometimes difficult to infer their purpose. The following methods have high density of IF/CASE statements: UserInterface.oneTwo(), Table.deleteItemByPk() and UserInterface.twoFour(). Perhaps these could be implemented more elegantly ? The "Table" class has very deep nesting, which could make it difficult to maintain in the long term. Be aware that there are some tightly coupled pairs of classes (Table<->Record, Database<->Table, UserInterface<->Database and UserInterface<->Table) which may benefit from refactoring to improve encapsulation and separation. The following methods have particularly complex structures: Database.showTables(), Table.checkFkConstriant(), Table.deleteItemByPk(), UserInterface.oneTwo() and UserInterface.twoFour() - this might make them difficult to comprehend. The following classes contain some unusual indentation: Table and Database. Significant amounts of code has been replicated in Table, Database and Record. Avoid copy-and-paste duplication: keep your code DRY ! Your code contains some "copy-and-pasted" method similarities: Database.showTables()-Table.printTableHead() and Table.printTableHead()-Table.printTable(). Remember to keep your code DRY !
